# Introduction and Objectives {background-iframe="template_files/libs/index.html"}


## What our project is about?

The `Russo-Ukrainian War` is an ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in 2014. The war has had a significant impact on both countries, with thousands of people killed and millions displaced. In this presentation, we will analyze the conflict using descriptive statistics to see some patterns and trends in the data.

. . .

So we decided to scroll [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=ukraine) and find a dataset that would help us to analyze the conflict in recent years.

# Data Description {background-iframe="template_files/libs/index.html"}

## Data Description

As it was mentioned before, we found some datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=ukraine). The dataset we chose contains information about the conflict in Ukraine from 2014 to 2021. It includes data on the number of casualties, attacks, and other relevant information.

. . .

So, the datasets:

1. [2022 Russia Ukraine War](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war) (updated weekly)

2. [2022 Russia Ukraine War, Losses, Oryx + Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russia-war-equipment-losses-oryx)

3. [Massive Missile Attacks on Ukraine](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/massive-missile-attacks-on-ukraine?select=missiles_and_uav.csv)


## 1. 2022 Russia Ukraine War

This dataset describes Equipment Losses & Death Toll & Military Wounded & Prisoner of War of russians in 2022-2024 Ukraine russia War by each day.

. . .

All data are official and additionally structured by the author ([Petro](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm)).

. . .

**Data:**

- `russia_losses_personnel.csv` - contains Personnel Losses during the war.

- `russia_losses_equipment.csv` - contains Equipment Losses during the war.

- `russia_losses_equipment_correction.csv` - contains some data correction *(dates: 2022-10-13, date: 2023-05-27)*.

## 2. 2022 Russia Ukraine War, Losses, Oryx + Images

The dataset describes russian and Ukrainian Equipment Losses During The 2022 Russian Invasion Of Ukraine.

. . .

The dataset was created based on [Oryx](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/) by scraping [Ukrainian losses](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html) and [russian losses](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) pages.

. . .

::: {.callout-note style="font-size: 90%;"}
## Note
The datasets mentioned above are updated regularly and provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing conflict. It is important to cross-verify the data with other sources for accuracy and reliability.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning style="font-size: 90%;"}
## Warning!
This list only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded!
:::

## 2. 2022 Russia Ukraine War, Losses, Oryx + Images

**Images data of Equipment Losses**

Images data include `pictures` of Equipment Losses. More than **18k (8 GB)** images of destroyed equipment can be found here.

## 3. Massive Missile Attacks on Ukraine

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
The dataset contains available information about launched and shot down missiles and drones during [russian massive missile and drone (UAV) strikes on infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure) (since October 2022) as part of its invasion of Ukraine. The dataset also contains information about some single shot-down UAVs.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

# Kvitka's Hypothesis {background-iframe="template_files/libs/index.html"}

## The missile attacks are more severe on significant days?

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
The severity level of missile attacks is determined based on the type of weapon used, categorized into six groups: 

- High-powered missiles
- Medium-powered missiles
- Drones
- Composite weapon types
- Low-powered missiles / Others
- Unknown
:::



## The missile attacks are more severe on significant days?

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Each category is assigned a predefined score reflecting its destructive potential, with high-powered missiles scoring the highest and drones or low-powered weapons scoring lower. 

:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
This scoring system standardizes the assessment of attack intensity, enabling comparative analysis across different events or time periods.

| Weapon Category               | Severity Score |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| High-powered missiles         | 10             |
| Medium-powered missiles       | 7              |
| Drones                        | 3              |
| Composite weapon types        | 5              |

. . .

As we can see the `{r} result$p.value` > 0.05. Meaning there is `no eveidence` to reject the $H_0$ hypothesis.

## $\text{t}$-test for filtered data

The  group of unsignificant days has a lot of outliers. Therefore i decided to filter out the anomal values using IQR.
```{r}
Q1 <- quantile(missile_attacks_score_per_day_significant$total_score_per_day, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(missile_attacks_score_per_day_significant$total_score_per_day, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

upper_threshold <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

filtered_date <- missile_attacks_score_per_day_significant %>% filter(total_score_per_day < upper_threshold)
summary(filtered_date)
```

    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )
```

:::

As you can see the amount of outliers are now `much lower`.
So, let`s conduct the $\text{t}$-test one more time.

--- 

```{r} 
result <- t.test(total_score_per_day ~ significant_date, filtered_date, alternative = "less")
result
```

As we can see the **`{r} result$p.value` > 0.05**. Meaning there is still `no evidence` to reject the $H_0$ hypothesis.

## Summary 
The analysis revealed no evidence of a connection between significant dates and the severity of missile attacks. 

. . .

Statistical testing showed no significant difference in attack severity between significant and non-significant dates. This indicates that the chosen significant dates do not influence the intensity of missile strikes.

## Model 1. Summary

- **Intercept** (2058.375): Baseline equipment loss points when shelling points are zero.  
- **Slope** (24.461): Each additional shelling point increases equipment loss by ~24.46 points.  
- **Significance** (Pr(>|t|) < 2e-16): Both coefficients are highly significant.  
- **R-squared** (0.1309): Shelling explains 13.09% of equipment loss variability, suggesting other factors play a major role.
